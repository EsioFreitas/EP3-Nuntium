He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in the world.  Mickey first was seen in a single test screening (Plane Crazy). Mickey officially debuted in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "photo"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007f9614ca9c28 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20180630-15134-932xlb.png>, @original_filename="Captura de tela de 2018-03-29 08-32-59.png", @content_type="image/png", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"article[photo]\"; filename=\"Captura de tela de 2018-03-29 08-32-59.png\"\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"1"}

He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the most recognizable cartoon characters in the world.  Mickey first was seen in a single test screening (Plane Crazy). Mickey officially debuted in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.", "photo"=>#<ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile:0x007fb8c2763e50 @tempfile=#<Tempfile:/tmp/RackMultipart20180630-16024-19lgtno.png>, @original_filename="Captura de tela de 2018-03-29 08-32-59.png", @content_type="image/png", @headers="Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"article[photo]\"; filename=\"Captura de tela de 2018-03-29 08-32-59.png\"\r\nContent-Type: image/png\r\n">}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"1"}
